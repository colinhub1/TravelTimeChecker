# TravelTimeChecker
Uses GoogleMaps API to alert user (with music) when time from point A to point B reaches a desired duration.
User inputs start and end locations, desired time spent driving, and time in between API calls.

GoogleMaps API belongs to Google, I do not own it.
Song is Le Reve (Getty remix) by Mossari. Any song and file works in place of this one as long as your system can run it.

Linux users may have issues using os library to run files this way.

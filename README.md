# TravelTimeChecker
Uses GoogleMaps API to alert user (with music) when time from point A to point B reaches a desired duration.
User inputs start and end locations, desired time spent driving, and time in between API calls.

GoogleMaps API belongs to Google, I do not own it
Song is Hello, found on Shopping King Louis OST. Any song and file works in place of this one.
